Desk -> Sailthru Summary
=======

Use it to send a summary from desk.com (formerly assistly) with sailthru and twurl

Be sure to make the following updates:

1) update sailthru() with your api key/secret

2) install twurl (gem install twurl), sailthru (gem install sailthru-client) and json (gem install json)

3) update host in desk()

4) consider using sailthrutemplate in Sailthru - averages time to open for each user and removes closed cases from the summary in zephyr
