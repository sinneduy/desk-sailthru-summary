Use it to send a summary from desk.com (formerly assistly) with sailthru and twurl

Be sure to make the following updates:

1) update sailthru() with your api key/secret

2) install twurl (gem install twurl), sailthru (gem install sailthru) and json (gem install json)

3) update host in desk()

4) consider using the sailthrutemplate provided in Sailthru - averages time to open for each user as well as removes closed cases from the summary
